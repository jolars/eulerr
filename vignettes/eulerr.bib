	abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the association between the differential gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients with their immunogenetic (human leucocyte antigen shared-epitope, HLA-SE), autoimmune response [anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies], disease activity score (DAS-28) and treatment (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and tumour necrosis factor blocker) features. Total RNA samples were copied into Cy3-labelled complementary DNA probes, hybridized onto a glass slide microarray containing 4500 human IMAGE complementary DNA target sequences. The Cy3-monocolour microarray images from patients were quantified and normalized. Analysis of the data using the significance analysis of microarrays algorithm together with a Venn diagram allowed the identification of shared and of exclusively modulated genes, according to patient features. Thirteen genes were exclusively associated with the presence of HLA-SE alleles, whose major biological function was related to signal transduction, phosphorylation and apoptosis. Ninety-one genes were associated with disease activity, being involved in signal transduction, apoptosis, response to stress and DNA damage. One hundred and one genes were associated with the presence of anti-CCP antibodies, being involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Twenty-eight genes were associated with tumour necrosis factor blocker treatment, being involved in intracellular signalling cascade, phosphorylation and protein transport. Some of these genes had been previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, whereas others were unveiled for future research.},

	abstract = {Many problems in statistics, finance, biology, pharmacology, physics, mathematics, eco nomics, and chemistry involve determination of the global minimum of multidimensional functions. R packages for different stochastic methods such as genetic algorithms and differential evolution have been developed and successfully used in the R community. Based on Tsallis statistics, the R package GenSA was developed for generalized simulated annealing to process complicated non-linear objective functions with a large number of local minima. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the R package and demonstrate its utility by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization problem in finance and the Thomson problem in physics. GenSA is useful and can serve as a complementary tool to, rather than a replacement for, other widely used R packages for optimization.},

Nash, Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Canada A systematic and comprehensive treatment of optimization software using R In recent decades, optimization techniques have been streamlined by computational and artificial intelligence methods to analyze more variables, especially under non–linear, multivariable conditions, more quickly than ever before. Optimization is an important tool for decision science and for the analysis of physical systems used in engineering. Nonlinear Parameter Optimization with R explores the principal tools available in R for function minimization, optimization, and nonlinear parameter determination and features numerous examples throughout. Nonlinear Parameter Optimization with R:  Provides a comprehensive treatment of optimization techniques Examines optimization problems that arise in statistics and how to solve them using R Enables researchers and practitioners to solve parameter determination problems Presents traditional methods as well as recent developments in R Is supported by an accompanying website featuring R code, examples and datasets  Researchers and practitioners who have to solve parameter determination problems who are users of R but are novices in the field optimization or function minimization will benefit from this book. It will also be useful for scientists building and estimating nonlinear models in various fields such as hydrology, sports forecasting, ecology, chemical engineering, pharmaco-kinetics, agriculture, economics and statistics.},
